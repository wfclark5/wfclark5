### 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;About Me

💡 &nbsp; I'm a Software Developer with a focus on Big Data Engineering and Machine Learning. Currently, I'm facilitating the build out and implementation of DataOps and MLOps at Blue Cross NC. Previously, I worked on analytic and software solutions for applied research initiatives at large research institutions (University of Nottingham – Ningbo China, Duke’s School of Medicine, Duke’s Pratt School of Engineering, NC State), Federal (NOAA, NASA, CDC, EPA, USFS), State (NC, SC, FL, VA) and local governments (Triangle J, Land of Sky, and others).

💻 &nbsp; Analytic domains that I have expertise in are Healthcare (Clinical Measures, EHR, Societal Drivers of Health, Behavioral Health, Value Based Care, Epidemiology), Risk Valuations (Risk Revenue, Property and Casualty Catastrophe Modeling), Geospatial (Satellite Imagery, Climate and Weather Resilience). 

🎓&nbsp;I hold a BS in Atmospheric Sciences from the University of North Carolina at Asheville and an MS in Computer Science from East Carolina University. 

🌱 &nbsp; My research interests are in applying organizational behavior theory to measure team performance of development teams. Analytic domains I want learn more about are streaming analytics, insurance-linked securities, seasonality of commodities, and supply chain analytics. The technologies I think that will shape the future are in-situ/remote sensing (Wearables, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Satellites, Ground Penetrating Radar), Edge Computing (IoT), and Applied AI.

✍️ &nbsp;In my free time, I enjoy carpentry, movies, and spending time with my loved ones.

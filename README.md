### üë®üèª‚Äçüíª &nbsp;About Me
üí° &nbsp; I'm a Software Developer with a focus on Data Analysis, Data Engineering, and Machine Learning. Currently, I'm facilitating the build out and implementation of  DataOps and MLOps at Blue Cross NC. Previously, I collaborated with scientists and government officials to build out applied research analytics and applications within the following organizations:

* Academic Research Institutions: Duke University‚Äôs School of Medicine and School of Engineering, The University of Nottingham at Ningbo China,  NC State's CISESS
* U.S. Federal Government: USGCRP, NOAA (NCEI, NESDIS), NASA (Earth Science Division), and USDA (Forest Service)
* U.S. States and Territories Governments
* Local Governments: Regional Councils, County Governments, City Governments
    
üíª &nbsp; I have worked on projects across a variety of industry domains and have built analytics and applications using various analytic stacks. 

* Analytic Domains and Topics: 

    * Climate Resilience and Adaptation
    * Numerical Weather Prediction
    * Property and Casualty Catastrophe Modeling
    * Computational Geometry and Geospatial Analysis
    * Clinical Research
    * Health Insurance
    * Developer Optimization Metrics


üéì &nbsp;I hold a BS in Atmospheric Sciences from the University of North Carolina at Asheville and an MS in Computer Science from East Carolina University. 

üå± &nbsp; My research interests are in applying organizational behavior theory to measure team performance of development teams. Analytic domains I want learn more about are streaming analytics, insurance-linked securities, seasonality of commodities, and supply chain analytics. The technologies I think that will shape the future are in-situ/remote sensing (Wearables, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Satellites, Ground Penetrating Radar), Edge Computing (IoT), and Applied AI.

‚úçÔ∏è &nbsp;In my free time, I enjoy carpentry, movies, and spending time with my loved ones.

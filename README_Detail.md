### üë®üèª‚Äçüíª &nbsp;About Me

üí° &nbsp; I'm a Software Developer with a focus on Data Analysis, Data Engineering, and Machine Learning. Currently, I'm facilitating the build out and implementation of  DataOps and MLOps at Blue Cross NC. Previously, I collaborated with scientists and government officials to build out applied research analytics and applications within the following organizations:

* Academic Research Institutions:  
  * Duke University‚Äôs School of Medicine - Center for Autism and Brain Development 
  * Duke University's Pratt School of Engineering - Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering 
  * The University of Nottingham at Ningbo China - Department of Geographical Science 
  * NC State's Cooperative Institute for Satellite Earth System Studies (NCICS) 
  
* U.S. Federal Government:
  * USGCRP, NOAA (NCEI, NESDIS), NASA (Earth Science Division), and USDA (Forest Service)
  
* U.S. States and Territories Governments:
  * States: 
    * North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Virginia 
  * Territories: 
    * Hawai‚Äòi, American Samoa, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Guam 

* Local Governments:
  * Regional Councils: 
    * Land of Sky Regional Council (Buncombe, Henderson, Madison and Transylvania Counties)
    * Triangle J Regional Council (Chatham, Durham, Johnston, Lee, Moore, Orange, and Wake Counties) 
    
  * County Governments:  
    *  Broward County (FL)
    
  * City Governments:  
    * City of Cary (NC), City of Asheville (NC), City of Charelston (SC)

üéì &nbsp;I hold a BS in Atmospheric Sciences from the University of North Carolina at Asheville and an MS in Computer Science from East Carolina University. 

üå± &nbsp; My research interests are in applying organizational behavior theory to measure team performance of development teams. Analytic domains I want learn more about are streaming analytics, insurance-linked securities, seasonality of commodities, and supply chain analytics. The technologies I think that will shape the future are in-situ/remote sensing (Wearables, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Satellites, Ground Penetrating Radar), Edge Computing (IoT), and Applied AI.

‚úçÔ∏è &nbsp;In my free time, I enjoy carpentry, movies, and spending time with my loved ones.

### &nbsp;About Me

üë®üèª‚Äçüíª &nbsp; I'm a Software Developer with a focus on Data Analytics, Data Engineering, and Machine Learning. Currently, I'm facilitating the build out and implementation of  DataOps and MLOps at Blue Cross NC. I hold a B.S. in Atmospheric Sciences from the University of North Carolina at Asheville and an M.S. in Computer Science from East Carolina University. 

üå± &nbsp; My research interests are in applying organizational behavior theory to measure team performance of development teams. Analytic domains I want learn more about are streaming analytics, insurance-linked securities, seasonality of commodities, and supply chain analytics. The technologies I believe will shape the future are in-situ/remote sensing (Wearables, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Satellites, Ground Penetrating Radar), Edge Computing (IoT), and Applied AI.

‚úçÔ∏è &nbsp;In my free time, I enjoy carpentry, movies, and spending time with my loved ones.
